# FinOps
- The collabration between Finance(BUSINESS/ MANAGEMENT) and DevOps.
- DevOps team reducing the public cloud(AWS, AZURE, GCP) cost while working very closely/ collabrating with management team is called ** FinOps**.
- Is FinOps not for OnPrem cloud?? **Definetly Not**
- FinOps Team pre-req:
-- **Understand Cloud Usage and Resources utilized**
  Lets say 5 AWS account in your Organization. You should understand what exactly each  account is doing? and who are using which AWS account? Who has access to AWS account?
  You shoud create in a spreadsheet or any FinOps tools. **Note:** Should understand which team is responsible for each account usage?
-- **Understand Cloud Budgeting**
  Every org has particular budget they estimate at begginging of the year for the financial year.
  You should understad Team A  is using 'X' amount and Team B is using 'Y' amount.
-- **Cloud Cost Optimization**
  Most critical step of FinOps. FinOps engineering team comes with best practises like scripts or identifying stale resources or deleting stale resources or creating monitors or taking unused backups and share with Team members in org. The reason to share with team members is it not responsible of single person about increase cost of AWS.
-- **Create reporting and Dashboards**
  Reports and Dashboards should be open to entire team members working. Every team should be transparent about the cloud cost of different team. The reason is:
  Is the team exceeded the budget? or are they within the budget?
-- **Forecasting**
  DevOps team will work with management and estimate the accurate budgeting.
  Ex: AWS cloud cost of Team X for financial year 2025.
