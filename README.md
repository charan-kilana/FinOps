# FinOps

**FinOps** is the collaboration between **Finance (Business/Management)** and **DevOps** teams to manage and reduce public cloud costs (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) effectively.

## üìå What is FinOps?

- It's the practice where DevOps works closely with finance or management teams to reduce and manage cloud costs.
- Is FinOps for On-Prem clouds? **Definitely Not** ‚Äî FinOps is primarily focused on **public cloud** usage and cost optimization.

## ‚úÖ FinOps Team Prerequisites

### 1. **Understand Cloud Usage and Resources Utilized**
- Example: If your organization has 5 AWS accounts, you should know:
  - What each account is used for.
  - Who is using each account.
  - Who has access to each account.
- Maintain this data in a **spreadsheet** or a **FinOps tool**.
- > üìå Note: Understand which team is responsible for each account's usage.

---

### 2. **Understand Cloud Budgeting**
- Organizations usually set a cloud budget at the beginning of each financial year.
- Example:
  - Team A is allocated budget `X`.
  - Team B is allocated budget `Y`.

---

### 3. **Cloud Cost Optimization**
- This is the **most critical** part of FinOps.
- The FinOps engineering team should:
  - Identify stale or unused resources.
  - Create automation/scripts to clean them up.
  - Set up monitors and alerts for cost spikes.
  - Take action on unused backups.
  - **Share** these best practices with all teams.
- > ‚úÖ Cost responsibility is shared across the organization, not just with one person or team.

---

### 4. **Create Reporting and Dashboards**
- Make cost reports and dashboards **visible to all teams**.
- Promotes transparency in cloud cost consumption.
- Helps answer:
  - Is the team exceeding their budget?
  - Are they within the allocated budget?

---

### 5. **Forecasting**
- The DevOps team works with management to **estimate accurate cloud budgeting**.
- > Example: Forecast AWS cloud cost for Team X for the financial year 2025.
